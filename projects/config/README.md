# Snail Ecosystem: Configurator

You may wish to take a look at [the wiki](https://bitbucket.org/ecosnail/config/wiki) for basic ideas and vision behind the Configurator.

## How to write code

* Do not merge to master, rebase instead.
* master should always build.
* Create your private branches with `<username>/` prefix.  
  You are free to do with them whatever you like.
* Lines of code must not be longer than 80 symbols. Please.

Note that the wiki repository is included as a submodule into the main one. If you wish to have a local copy of it, do a `git submodule update --init`, or just clone as `git clone <url> <dir> --recursive`.
